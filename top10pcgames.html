	Need for Speed Heat (stylized as NFS Heat) is a 2019 racing video game developed by Ghost Games<br> 
	and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. <br>
	It is the twenty-fourth installment in the Need for Speed series and commemorates the series' 25th anniversary. <br>
	The game received mixed reviews from critics, who mostly found the game to be an improvement over the 2015 Need for Speed reboot<br>
	 and Payback but not enough to be a full return to form for the franchise.<br>
Heat was Ghost Games' final game both for the Need for Speed franchise and as a lead developer.<br>
 In February 2020, EA shifted development of the franchise back to Criterion Games—the developers of the Burnout series,<br>
  Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010) and Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012)—and<br>
   reduced Ghost Games to an engineering studio for the Frostbite engine, reverting their name back to EA Gothenburg.<br></font><br>
